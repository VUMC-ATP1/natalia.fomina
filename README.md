## ***Something about myself***

I am a tester with about 2 years of manual and automate testing experience in different project and technological environments.
* I have extensively written test cases, executed test cases and written bug reports on different applications - successfully performed testing like funktional testing, regression testing and acceptance testing.
* I have experience with Selenium automation tool: automated some manual test suites, so saved a lot of time spent on repetive work.
* I am also proficient in writing SQL queries.
* Now I am attending [Automated software testing](https://edu.lu.lv/enrol/index.php?id=2225) course to keep in touch with new developments in testing and improve my self esteem, motivation and confidence.

## ***Why do I like testing***

Software testing is the most interesting job because it throws challenges every day.
Tester has to stretch the mind to understand, to find out how it should work and how it should not, to study the general behavior, to improve the application by the analysis, to learn new tools and implementing the learning in real life. And the tester has to understand how badly end users can handle the application and has to imagine what could be end userâ€™s expectations.
